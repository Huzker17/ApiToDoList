This Web-Api project created for ToDoList(My first experience with Web-Api).


In this project I used PostgreSql, EntitiyFramework, Swagger, AutoMap, IMediatR.




I'm not so good at WebApi and writing tests, but I'll learn everthing. I had a big deal with this sctruturing and finding required places to create commands and quieries, same thing for dependecyInjections and for everything in this project)
