This Web-Api project created for ToDoList.


After launch go to link https://localhost:44328/swagger/index.html


In this project I used PostgreSql, EntitiyFramework.


Then check all Actions for entities


I'm not so good at WebApi and writing tests, but I'll learn everthing. Better know MVC and ajax-requests
